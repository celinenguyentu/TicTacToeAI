# TicTacToeAI

An AI based on reinforcement learning using SARSA to play Tic Tac Toe.

The project was to implement the algorithm of an AI capable of learning and playing on a scalable board. However, the graphical interface is still at a rudimentary stage; there's a lot to be improved in the future.

## Usage

### Requirements

* You need Python 3.9 to run the program. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* `pip` must be installed.

### Installation

Git clone this repository :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/celinenguyentu/TicTacToeAI && cd TicTacToeAI
```

Create and activate a virtual environment :
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies :
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Launch the program :
```bash
python TicTacToe.py
```

## Future improvements

- [ ] Allow each player to start the game alternatively.
- [ ] Add a mode to train the AI in order to observe its improvement over time.
- [ ] Add an option to pick the board size, up to a ?x? board.
- [ ] Optimize and enhance the graphical interface.
